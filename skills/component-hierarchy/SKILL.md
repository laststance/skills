  Visualize where a React component sits in the Next.js component tree, from the top-level
  Page down to the target component, as an ASCII tree diagram with file paths.
  Supports both App Router (app/) and Pages Router (pages/).

  Use this skill whenever you need to understand a component's position in the rendering
  hierarchy, trace the parent chain from a component up to its Page, or visualize how
  components are nested. Especially useful for onboarding to unfamiliar codebases, debugging
  prop drilling, understanding render boundaries, or explaining architecture to teammates.

  Triggers on:
  - "Where is X component used?" or "Where does X sit in the tree?"
  - "Show me the component hierarchy for X"
  - "Which page renders X?"
  - "Component tree", "component hierarchy", "component position"
  - "コンポーネント階層", "コンポーネントの位置", "どこで使われている"
  - Any question about a component's nesting depth or parent chain in Next.js

# Component Hierarchy Visualizer

Trace a React component's position in the Next.js component tree and display it as an
easy-to-read ASCII tree diagram from the Page root down to the target component.

## Required MCP Tools

- **Serena**: `find_file`, `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `get_symbols_overview`, `search_for_pattern`, `list_dir`
- **Sequential Thinking**: `sequentialthinking` — for organizing the recursive trace logic
- **Context7** (optional): `resolve-library-id`, `query-docs` — for referencing Next.js routing docs when needed

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Router Type

Determine whether the project uses App Router, Pages Router, or both.

1. Use Serena `list_dir` on the project root to check for:
   - `src/app/` or `app/` → **App Router**
   - `src/pages/` or `pages/` → **Pages Router**
   - Both can coexist
2. If unclear, use Serena `find_file` to search for `page.tsx` (App Router indicator) and
   check for a `pages/` directory structure.

The router type determines what counts as a "Page" (the root of the component tree):
- **Pages Router**: Any default-exported component in `pages/**/*.tsx` (excluding `_app`, `_document`)
- **App Router**: The default export in `app/**/page.tsx`, with `layout.tsx` as wrapping ancestors

### Step 2: Locate the Target Component

The user provides either a component name (e.g., `OrderSearchBox`) or a file name
(e.g., `OrderSearchBox.tsx`).

1. **File name given**: Use Serena `find_file` with the file name to locate the file path.
2. **Component name given**: Use Serena `find_symbol` with `name_path_pattern` set to the
   component name. If multiple matches exist, present them and ask the user to choose.
3. **No target given**: infer from the user's IDE context if available.
   - Prefer the currently focused file.
   - In that file, prefer the default-exported component or the primary exported React component.
   - If multiple likely components exist, ask the user to choose.
4. Confirm the component's file path and exported symbol name.

### Step 3: Trace Upward (Bottom-Up Traversal)

This is the core of the skill. Starting from the target component, recursively find parent
components until reaching a Page file.

Use Sequential Thinking to organize each step of the trace:

```
For each component in the chain (starting with the target):
  1. Call Serena find_referencing_symbols with the component's symbol name and file path
  2. Filter results to find JSX usage (look for <ComponentName in the referencing code snippets)
  3. If that result is empty or does not reveal a usable JSX parent, immediately fall back to:
     a. search_for_pattern("<ComponentName\\b")
     b. search_for_pattern("import .*ComponentName")
     c. inspect the matched file with get_symbols_overview or find_symbol
     d. only after these fail, consider the component potentially orphaned
  4. For each referencing parent:
     a. Record: parent component name, parent file path
     b. Check if the parent file is a Page file:
        - Pages Router: file path matches pages/**/*.tsx (not _app, _document)
        - App Router: file path ends with page.tsx or layout.tsx
     c. If Page found → trace complete for this path
     d. If not Page → continue tracing upward from this parent
  5. Handle edge cases:
     - If a component is re-exported through an index file, trace through the re-export
     - If multiple parents exist, trace ALL paths (component used in multiple places)
     - Set a depth limit of 20 to prevent infinite loops
     - If no JSX parent is found even after fallback searches, report "orphan component" (not rendered by any Page)
```

**Important**: When `find_referencing_symbols` returns results, look at the `relative_path` of
the referencing symbol to determine the parent file. Then use `find_symbol` or
`get_symbols_overview` on that file to identify the parent component name.

**Parent selection rule**: when identifying the parent component from a file, choose in this order:
1. the exported React component for the file
2. the top-level symbol that returns JSX around the matched usage
3. the best `get_symbols_overview` candidate that encloses the JSX usage

Avoid choosing helper hooks, memo callback internals, or unrelated file-level symbols as the parent.

### Step 4: Detect Wrapper Components

For Pages Router projects, check for common wrapping components:
- `_app.tsx` / `_app.js` — wraps all pages, include in the hierarchy as the outermost wrapper
- `PageComponent.getLayout = (...)` — include these wrappers between `_app.tsx` and the page body
- Provider components (Context providers, theme providers) that wrap the entire app

For App Router projects:
- `layout.tsx` files at each route segment level — each one wraps its child pages/layouts
- `template.tsx` if present

### Step 5: Build and Display the Tree

Assemble the traced paths into an ASCII tree diagram.

**Output format:**

```
📄 Page: /orders
   Route file: src/pages/orders/index.tsx
   Router: Pages Router
   Route root: OrdersPage
   Render path root: OrderLayout

🌳 Component Hierarchy:

_app.tsx (src/pages/_app.tsx)
└── OrdersPage (src/pages/orders/index.tsx)
    └── getLayout wrappers
        └── OrderLayout (src/features/orders/OrderLayout.tsx)
            ├── OrderSearchBox ⭐ TARGET (src/features/shared/order_search/order_search_box/OrderSearchBox.tsx)
            └── OrderTable (src/features/orders/OrderTable.tsx)

📊 Route depth: 3 levels from Page
📊 Render depth: 2 levels from render root
```

When a component appears in **multiple pages**, show all paths:

```
📄 Component "OrderSearchBox" is used in 2 pages:

━━━ Path 1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📄 Page: /orders
   Route file: src/pages/orders/index.tsx
   Route root: OrdersPage
   Render path root: OrdersPage

_app.tsx (src/pages/_app.tsx)
└── OrdersPage (src/pages/orders/index.tsx)
    └── OrderSearchBox ⭐ TARGET

━━━ Path 2 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📄 Page: /dashboard
   Route file: src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx
   Route root: DashboardPage
   Render path root: SearchPanel

_app.tsx (src/pages/_app.tsx)
└── DashboardPage (src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx)
    └── SearchPanel (src/features/dashboard/SearchPanel.tsx)
        └── OrderSearchBox ⭐ TARGET
```

### Tree Drawing Rules

- Use `└──` for the last child, `├──` for other children
- Use `│` for vertical continuation lines
- Each node shows: `ComponentName (relative/file/path.tsx)`
- Mark the target with `⭐ TARGET`
- Show sibling components at the same level when they share the nearest parent (provides context)
- Prefer direct JSX siblings from the nearest returned JSX block, not unrelated file-level symbols
- Keep sibling display limited to at most 5 siblings to avoid noise; if more exist, show
  `... and N more siblings`
- If `getLayout`, `_app.tsx`, or `layout.tsx` wrappers exist, show them explicitly above the main render chain

### Depth Definitions

- **Route depth**: levels from the route file's page component to the target
- **Render depth**: levels from the practical render root after wrappers such as `getLayout` or `layout.tsx`

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Handling |
|-----------|----------|
| Component not found | Report clearly; suggest checking the name/file spelling |
| Orphan component (no page renders it) | Only conclude this after trying `find_referencing_symbols` and the fallback `search_for_pattern` passes; then show the partial chain and note it's not connected to any page |
| Circular reference detected | Stop and report the cycle |
| Component used only in tests | Note that it's only referenced from test files, not from any page |
| Re-export through index.ts | Follow the re-export chain to find the actual JSX usage |
| Dynamic import / lazy load | Note `(lazy loaded)` in the tree node |
| Component used inside a Modal/Portal | Note `(via Portal)` — the DOM hierarchy differs from component hierarchy |

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not execute or render the application
- Does not trace runtime props or state flow (see `prop-drill` or `code-trace` skills for that)
- Does not modify any files
- Does not trace into node_modules or external library internals
