# @param owner - GitHub repository owner
# @param repo - GitHub repository name
# @param pr_number - Pull request number
# @returns Exit 0 if rate limit detected + waited + full review triggered
#          Exit 1 if no rate limit found (normal flow)

# 1. REST returns `coderabbitai[bot]` for App-installed bots; older accounts
#    and some GraphQL endpoints return the bare `coderabbitai`. Match both.
# 2. CodeRabbit comment bodies are multi-line (starting with HTML auto-gen
#    markers, then markdown). The previous `head -1` of the joined-bodies
#    string took the *first line of the first body* — which is just the HTML
#    summary marker, never the rate-limit warning that lives further down.
#    Reduce to a single body inside jq so the entire body lands in the var.
