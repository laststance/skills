# Workflow: Plan Gate

**Purpose**: Present the design blueprint with visual diagrams and get explicit human approval.
**This is the acceptance gate — nothing proceeds without human's "accept".**

---

## Presentation Philosophy

🔴 **Diagrams first, text second.**

The design presentation prioritizes visual comprehension:
1. Architecture diagram shows WHAT changes and WHERE
2. Sequence diagram shows HOW the new flow works
3. File change table shows the SCOPE
4. TODO plan shows the STEPS

---

## Step 1: Present Design Blueprint

### Template

```markdown
🧠 **Design Blueprint: [Task Name]**

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Current
        A[Component A] --> B[Component B]
        B --> C[Component C]
    end

    subgraph Changes
        B --> D[New Component D]
        D -.-> E[Modified Component E]
    end

    style D fill:#a8e6cf,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#ffd3b6,stroke:#333
```

**Legend**: 🟢 New | 🟠 Modified | ⬜ Unchanged

---

## 2. Interaction Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant API
    participant Service
    participant DB

    User->>Frontend: Action
    Frontend->>API: Request
    API->>Service: Process
    Note over Service: New logic here
    Service->>DB: Query
    DB-->>Service: Result
    Service-->>API: Response
    API-->>Frontend: Data
    Frontend-->>User: Updated UI
```

---

## 3. Change Scope

| File | Action | What Changes |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `path/file1.ts` | 🟠 Modify | Add role parameter |
| `path/file2.ts` | 🟢 Create | New middleware |
| `path/file3.ts` | 🟠 Modify | Update type definitions |

**Breaking Change Risk**: [🟢 Low / 🟡 Medium / 🔴 High]
**Reason**: [Brief explanation]

---

## 4. Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| [Decision 1] | [Chosen option] | [Why this was chosen] |
| [Decision 2] | [Chosen option] | [Based on user's answer] |

---

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Section S01: [Name]
- T01.1: [Task]
- T01.2: [Task]
- T01.3: [Task]

### Section S02: [Name]
- T02.1: [Task]
- T02.2: [Task]

### Section S03: [Name]
- T03.1: [Task]
- T03.2: [Task]

**Total**: [N] sections, [M] TODOs

---
```

---

## Step 2: Ask for Approval

After presenting the full blueprint, ask for explicit approval:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "この設計で進めてよいですか？"
  header: "Plan Gate"
  options:
    - label: "Accept (実装開始)"
      description: "この設計プランを承認し、Section S01 からガイド開始"
    - label: "Adjust (調整)"
      description: "設計の一部を変更したい箇所がある"
    - label: "Redesign (再設計)"
      description: "アプローチを根本的に変えたい"
```

---

## Step 3: Handle Response

### Accept → Proceed to Implementation

```markdown
✅ **Plan Approved**

Starting with Section S01: [Name]
Proceeding to implementation guidance...
```

→ Route to `workflows/section-guidance.md` (Section S01, TODO T01.1)

### Adjust → Iterate on Design

1. Ask what needs adjustment:
   ```
   What would you like to change? Please describe the adjustments.
   ```

2. Update the affected parts of the design
3. Re-present the updated blueprint
4. Return to Step 2 (ask for approval again)

### Redesign → Back to Deep Design

```markdown
🔄 **Redesigning**

Let's rethink the approach. What direction would you prefer?
```

→ Route back to `workflows/deep-design.md` with new constraints

---

## Diagram Guidelines

### Architecture Diagram (graph TD)

**DO**:
- Use `subgraph` to group related components
- Color-code: green for new (`#a8e6cf`), orange for modified (`#ffd3b6`)
- Show data flow direction with arrows
- Mark new connections with dotted lines (`-.->`)
- Keep under 15 nodes for readability

**DON'T**:
- Include every file in the project
- Show implementation details inside nodes
- Use more than 3 levels of nesting

### Sequence Diagram

**DO**:
- Show the happy path first
- Use `alt` blocks for important branches
- Add `Note` annotations for key logic
- Include error paths if they're part of the design
- Show only participants relevant to the change

**DON'T**:
- Include every HTTP header or parameter
- Show database schema details
- Make it longer than ~20 interactions

### Additional Diagrams (Optional)

For complex designs, consider adding:

**State Diagram** (for state machines):
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Active: approve
    Active --> Suspended: suspend
    Suspended --> Active: reactivate
    Active --> [*]: delete
```

**ER Diagram** (for data model changes):
```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ ROLE : has
    ROLE ||--|{ PERMISSION : grants
```

**Class Diagram** (for type hierarchy):
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +string id
        +string email
        +UserRole role
    }
    class UserRole {
        <<enumeration>>
        ADMIN
        EDITOR
        VIEWER
    }
```

Use additional diagrams only when they add clarity to the design.
